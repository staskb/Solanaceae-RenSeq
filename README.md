The GitHub repository incldues annotation files for the Solanaceae RenSeq project.

# Annotation 
Contig: ContigNNN (e.g. Contig089) \ \

Gene/Proteins: Accession-Contig#-Gene#+Intact/Partial+Domain-based class+Phylogeny-based class.\ \
For instance, a gene named LA0411-035-1+I+CNL+G4 is from S. pimpinellifolium LA0411 and annotated from Contig035 as the first gene. Its NB-ARC domain is intact. Coiled-Coil, NB-ARC and LRR were detected. This gene was clustered in the clade G4.
